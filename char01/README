This is a basic example of a char device:
This module has a initialized buffer in kernel memory that you
can read from user space.
When its readed from user space, this device returns ONE character at a time from
kernel to user space.

Usage:
  1) make  --- This generate char_01.ko and test_module binary app.
  2) Insert module into kernel (as root): insmod char_01.ko
  3) Create /dev/char_01 node: mknod /dev/char_01 c [MAYOR_NUMBER] [MINOR_NUMBER]
    3.1) MAYOR and MINOR can be readed using cat /proc/devices
  4) cat /dev/char_01 or use test_module user app.
